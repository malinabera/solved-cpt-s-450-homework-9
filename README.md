the cipher text: ITG!AAEXEX IRRG!IGRXI OIXGEREAGO Tell me what is the plaintext? and HOW did you get it? (It is ok if you download some tools from the Internet to break the code)

<ol start="2">

 <li>Read Huffman code algorithm from the text or from the Internet. Recallthat the algorithm is to code a word in bits (i.e., a binary tree is constructed). Now, we use digits instead of bits, can you design a Huffman code algorithm?</li>

 <li>Try to read from the Internet and summarize (in half page) on currenttechniques in finding whether a cryptographic protocol has a flaw or not.</li>
